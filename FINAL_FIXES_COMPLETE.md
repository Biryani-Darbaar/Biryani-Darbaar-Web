# 🎉 All Issues Fixed - Final Update

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Modal Positioning Fix

**Problem:** When user scrolled down and clicked "Sign In", modals appeared stuck at the top of the page instead of centered in viewport.

**Solution:**

- Changed modal backdrop alignment to always center content
- Added `style={{ alignItems: 'center' }}` to backdrop
- Added `my-8` margin to modal containers
- Updated animation to include `y` transform for smoother appearance
- Both LoginModal and RegisterModal now properly center regardless of scroll position

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `src/components/modals/LoginModal.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/modals/RegisterModal.tsx`

---

### 2. Register Modal - Eye Button Removed from Confirm Password

**Problem:** Confirm password field had eye button (show/hide toggle) which was unnecessary.

**Solution:**

- Removed `showConfirmPassword` state variable
- Changed confirm password input type to always be `"password"`
- Removed toggle button from confirm password field
- Only the first password field now has the eye button toggle

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `src/components/modals/RegisterModal.tsx`

---

### 3. Address Validation Already Implemented

**Status:** ✅ Already working correctly

The address validation was already properly implemented:

```typescript
export const validateAddress = (address: string): string | null => {
  if (!address) return "Address is required";
  if (address.length < 10) return "Address must be at least 10 characters";
  return null;
};
```

Address is validated in RegisterModal before form submission.

### 4. Constants for Slider Content

**Problem:** Menu items and offers arrays were hardcoded in component files.

**Solution:**

- Created new constants file: `src/constants/SliderContent.ts`
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for type safety:
  - `DineInMenuItem` interface
  - `SpecialOffer` interface
- Exported constants:
  - `DINE_IN_MENU_ITEMS` array
  - `SPECIAL_OFFERS` array
- Updated components to import from constants

**Files Created:**

- ✅ `src/constants/SliderContent.ts` (NEW)

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ `src/components/sliders/DineInMenuSlider.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/sliders/ImageSlider.tsx`

**Benefits:**

- Single source of truth for slider content
- Easy to update content without modifying components
- Type-safe with proper interfaces
- Better code organization
