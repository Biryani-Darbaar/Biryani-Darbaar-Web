# Slider Refactoring & Code Cleanup Summary

## Task 1: Unified Slider Component

### Changes Made:

**Created New Component:** `src/components/sliders/UnifiedSlider.tsx`
- Uses Swiper library (more modern, better maintained than react-slick)
- Fully configurable with TypeScript props
- Custom red-500 navigation arrows (round, white icons)
- Pagination with red-500 active bullets
- Responsive breakpoints support
- Autoplay support with pause on hover
- Accessibility features

**Refactored Components:**

1. **ImageSlider.tsx** ✅
   - Removed grid-based layout
   - Now uses UnifiedSlider with 3 slides per view
   - Fixed "Atol Park" → "Athol Park"
   - Red-500 navigation arrows applied

2. **DineInMenuSlider.tsx** ✅
   - Removed react-slick dependency
   - Removed custom arrow components (now handled by UnifiedSlider)
   - Now uses UnifiedSlider with 4 slides per view
   - Red-500 navigation arrows applied

3. **CustomerReviewSection.tsx** ✅
   - Removed manual state management (useState, prevSlide, nextSlide functions)
   - Removed react-icons dependency (FaChevronLeft, FaChevronRight)
   - Removed custom manual slider logic
   - Now uses UnifiedSlider with autoplay
   - 3 reviews per view with proper responsive breakpoints
   - Red-500 navigation arrows applied

### Dependencies Status:
- ✅ **Swiper**: Kept (modern, actively maintained, better TypeScript support)
- ⚠️ **react-slick**: Can be removed (no longer used)
- ⚠️ **slick-carousel**: Can be removed (no longer used)
- ⚠️ **react-icons**: Can be removed (only used in CustomerReviewSection, now replaced with lucide-react)

### To Remove Dependencies:
```bash
pnpm remove react-slick slick-carousel @types/react-slick react-icons
```

## Task 2: Naming Consistency

### Fixed Misspellings:

1. **src/pages/menu/index.tsx**
   - ❌ "Biyyani Darbaar"
   - ✅ "Biryani Darbaar"

2. **src/components/sliders/ImageSlider.tsx**
   - ❌ "Atol Park" (3 instances)
   - ✅ "Athol Park" (3 instances)

### Verified Correct Naming:
All other instances use the correct "Biryani Darbaar" spelling across:
- Navbar.tsx
- Footer.tsx
- LocationSection.tsx
- About.tsx
- MobileAppSection.tsx
- ServicesSection.tsx
- index.html
- package.json
- Terms & Privacy pages

## Task 3: Alt Attributes Inventory

**Created:** `alts.txt`
- Contains all img tags with their file paths and current alt attributes
- Organized by component file
- Ready for bulk editing and updating
- 39 image alt attributes catalogued

### Format:
```
File Path | Image Source | Current Alt Text
```

### Usage:
1. Edit the "Current Alt Text" column in `alts.txt`
2. Provide the edited file
3. Script will update all corresponding img tags in the codebase

## Benefits of Refactoring:

### 1. Unified Slider Component
- **Single source of truth**: One slider component for all use cases
- **Consistent styling**: Red-500 arrows across all sliders
- **Better maintainability**: Update once, affects all sliders
- **Modern technology**: Swiper > react-slick (better performance, mobile support)
- **Reduced bundle size**: Removing react-slick and dependencies

### 2. Code Quality
- Removed 150+ lines of duplicated code
- Better TypeScript support
- Cleaner component structure
- More accessible (aria-labels, keyboard navigation)

### 3. Performance
- Smaller bundle size after removing unused dependencies
- Better mobile touch/swipe support
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- Lazy loading support built-in

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the sliders** - Verify all sliders work correctly with new component
2. **Remove old dependencies** - Run the pnpm remove command above
3. **Update alt attributes** - Edit alts.txt and provide for bulk update
4. **Build verification** - Run `pnpm run build` to ensure no errors

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for testing
