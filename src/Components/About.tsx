            Hyderabadi Biryani is not your regular rice dish‚Äîit's a slow-cooked
            masterpiece. We use the finest basmati rice, juicy meat, and a
            unique blend of handpicked spices, all layered and cooked to
            perfection using the traditional Dum Pukht method. The result? A
            rich, aromatic, and flavor-packed biryani that will transport you
            straight to the streets of Hyderabad.

            While our biryani is the star, we also serve various classic
            Hyderabadi dishes. Every dish is made with love and authenticity,
            from the creamy Haleem and spicy Mirchi Ka Salan to delicious
            curries and sizzling kebabs. And for those with a sweet tooth, our
            Qubani Ka Meetha (a traditional apricot dessert) is the perfect way
            to end your meal.
